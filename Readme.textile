h1. Delete All Contacts

Like it says on the tin, run this app and it'll delete all the contacts on your device.

*SERIOUSLY IT'LL DELETE ALL OF YOUR CONTACTS*

h2. Why?

Well I had contacts syncing with MobileMe. Then iCloud came along and I have a different AppleID that I use for everything (everything, except MobileMe). So I stop syncing my contacts with MobileMe and find that now I have two contacts, one on the device and one in iCloud. I only wanted ones on iCloud and going through 273 contacts, hitting delete on each one would have taken the best part of a couple of hours; This app took much less time. 

So if you're in the same position as me...

# Make sure your *contacts are actually on iCloud*
# *Turn off iCloud syncing* for contacts - I imagine this would destroy that data too and that would be bad!
# Build and run this app - it will *delete all of the contacts* on device
# Start iCloud syncing and watch the iCloud contacts come in
